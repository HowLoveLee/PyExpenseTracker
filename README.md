# 🐒Expense Tracker🐒
**Feel free to contribute!**

My first python project back in 2022. I rediscovered it today.
Codebase isn't the cleanest or very readable
(not even god remembers what I wrote 3 years ago).

MonkeyTracker is a tool designed to help keep you keep a 
track of your expenses and how much money is coming in.
Program a lil ugly i know bare with me. **Baby steps lads**.
## Plan (may or may not be in order):
- Full codebase restructure
- Naming conventions change
- Excel copycat shortcuts
- Dark, Light, Acrylic QSS themes.
- CSV & Excel imports
- Integration with **Plaid API**
- JSON GUI category editors
- **BUDGETING** (this is its own beast, more on it later)

## 🌟 Features (WIP)
Chef, give me a few more days, don’t fire me yet.
Once I update codebase I'll put what's already made 
and what needs to be added.

## Tech Stack
- Swap PYQT6 for PySide6
- pandas 
- plotly 
- matplotlib 
- seaborn(Will remove)
